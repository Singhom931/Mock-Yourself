SPEED, TIME & DISTANCE  04/01/2016  •Speed, Time and Distance:  
Speed =Distance/ Time ,Time =Distance/ Speed,  
Distance = (Speed x Time).  
•km/hr to m/sec conversion:  
x km/hr = x  *  5/18 m/sec.  
•m/sec to km/hr conversion:  
x m/sec = x  * 18/5 km/hr.  
•If the ratio of the speeds of A and B is  a : b, then the ratio 
of the  
the times taken by then to cover the same distance is 1/a:1/b 
or b : a. 
•Suppose a man covers a certain distance at  x km/hr and an 
equal    distance at  y km/hr. Then, the average speed during 
the whole journey is(2 xy)/x+y km/hr.
