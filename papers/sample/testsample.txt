Question 3:
What is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter? Provide examples of programming languages that use each.
a) A compiler translates code line by line, while an interpreter translates the entire code at once. Examples: C (compiler), Python (interpreter).
b) A compiler translates the entire code at once, while an interpreter translates code line by line. Examples: Python (compiler), C (interpreter).
c) Both compilers and interpreters translate code line by line. Examples: Java (compiler), Ruby (interpreter).
d) Both compilers and interpreters translate the entire code at once. Examples: Java (compiler), Ruby (interpreter).
Correct Answer: a)

Question 4:
What is a database index? How does it improve the performance of database queries?
a) It improves query performance by sorting the tables. 
b) It improves query performance by creating a sorted copy of the entire database.
c) It improves query performance by allowing direct access to rows in a table based on specific columns.
d) It improves query performance by creating a copy of the database in memory.
